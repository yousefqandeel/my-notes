**Who am I?** 

*My name is Yousef, I'm 21 years old, I'm graduate from Al al-Bayt University in three and a half years whit very-good grade, I love programming especially backend.*

**What I learned after reading tha article?**

There are common issues talked about by developers very often. These stories are experienced in every development team, I will mention only three of them:

1. **Conceiving The Purpose of Software**

    *First of all, you should understand the purpose of the software. There is, in fact, a single purpose of all software: To help people.*
    - When you are making decisions about software, you should guide yourself by always keeping this in mind: How we can help? You can even prioritize feature requests this way.

2. **Prioritizing**
    - There are three important factors that will help me make a better decision. This equation is explained very well in the Code Simplicity book:
        - The desirability of a change {D):How much do I want that change to happen?
        - The value of a change {V):How much value does the change offer? How much does it help Ir
        users?
        - The effort required to perfon11 the change {E):How much work will I need to do to acco•plish this change?
    - The equation is simple:D=V/E
        - The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the change.Code Simplicity.
        "When I prioritize my work, I should follow this rule:"
        - The changes that will bring I a lot of value and require little effort are better
        than those that will bring little value and require a lot of effort.
3. **Solving Problems**
    - The first step is understanding. Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don't understand them.Write down your problem and try to explain it to someone else. *"If you can't explain something  in simple terms, you don't understand it"". - Richard Feynman"*

    - The second step is planning. Don't take action. Sleep on it.Give your brain some ti•e to analyze the problem and process the information but don't spend too much ti•e on planning.
    - Think before acting.
    "- The third step is dividing.Don t try to solve one big problem .When you look at the problem as a whole, it can scare you.Divide it into smaller tasks and solve each sub-problem one by"
    "one.Once you solve each sub-problem, you connect the dots."
